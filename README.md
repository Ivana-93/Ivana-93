## Hi I'm Ivana <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" height="28px" alt="hi">

ðŸš€ I'm Ivana Ä†osiÄ‡, a marketing specialist and a self-taught software developer. After realizing that PR started to mean 'pull request' and not 'public relations', I knew I found my new career path. I began with learning Python, but with time my interest in web development started to grow, so now I commit myself to Angular!
